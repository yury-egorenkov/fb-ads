# Ad Campaign Optimization Through Testing

## Problem Statement
When all targeting parameters are set in a single ad campaign, the ad network tends to find the least cost-effective parameter combination and consume the entire advertising budget. These parameters maximize the ad network's revenue (high frequency and high price) while being least beneficial for the advertiser.

## Solution Workflow

1. **Campaign Configuration**
   - User creates a YAML file containing ad creatives, possible targeting options, and ad parameters
   - Example YAML format:
     ```yaml
     campaign:
       name: "Test Campaign Series Q1"
       total_budget: 1000.00
       test_budget_percentage: 20
       max_cpm: 15.00
     
     creatives:
       - id: "creative1"
         title: "Summer Sale"
         description: "Get 50% off"
         image_url: "https://example.com/image1.jpg"
       - id: "creative2"
         title: "New Arrivals"
         description: "Check out our latest products"
         image_url: "https://example.com/image2.jpg"
     
     targeting_options:
       audiences:
         - id: "audience1"
           name: "18-24 Male"
           parameters:
             age_min: 18
             age_max: 24
             genders: [1]
         - id: "audience2"
           name: "25-34 Female" 
           parameters:
             age_min: 25
             age_max: 34
             genders: [2]
       placements:
         - id: "placement1"
           name: "Facebook Feed"
           position: "feed"
         - id: "placement2"
           name: "Instagram Stories"
           position: "story"
     ```

2. **Test Campaign Creation**
   - Generate multiple campaign combinations, each testing one ad + one parameter
   - Implement pagination and prioritization for creation
   - Allow creation of only first N campaigns (determined by test budget size)
   - Require both total ad budget and testing percentage to be specified
   - API rate limiting: Implement exponential backoff for FB API calls

3. **Budget Allocation**
   - Allocate test budget (e.g., $10 lifetime) to each created campaign
   - Calculate as: total test budget / number of test campaigns
   - Use automatic bidding for CPM (cost per thousand impressions)

4. **Data Collection**
   - Gather statistics after 48 hours exactly, focusing on impression count and click costs
   - Minimum data threshold: At least 1000 impressions per campaign to ensure statistical significance
   - Metrics to collect: impressions, clicks, CTR, CPC, CPM, conversions (if applicable)

5. **Optimization Decision**
   - Terminate campaigns with impression counts below the worst active campaign
   - Continue and adjust CPM for promising campaigns
   - Set maximum CPM = average CPM of all active campaigns + 1 standard deviation
   - Honor user-defined maximum CPM threshold
   - Error handling: Log failed campaign updates and retry up to 3 times with 5-minute intervals

6. **Command Structure**
   - Implement dedicated command to launch new testing batch
   - Implement dedicated command to update pricing for all active campaigns per optimization rules
   - Rollback procedure: Include `--rollback-to=TIMESTAMP` flag to revert to previous campaign states

## Success Metrics (KPIs)
- Primary: Reduction in overall CPC (Cost Per Click) by at least 15%
- Secondary: Increase in CTR (Click-Through Rate) by at least 10%
- Tertiary: Reduction in total budget spend for equivalent results

## Monitoring Requirements
- Daily performance reports for all active campaigns
- Alerts for campaigns with abnormal performance (>2 std dev from average)
- Weekly optimization effectiveness report comparing pre/post-optimization metrics
